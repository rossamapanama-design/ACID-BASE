# Classification Game: Acids, Bases, and Salts (Grade 11)

Role: Chemistry teacher — quick, competitive sorting activity for students to practice identifying strong acids, strong bases, weak acids, weak bases, and salts.  
Rules:
- Students receive the mixed list of 40 terms and must sort each term into one of these five groups:
  - Strong acids
  - Strong bases
  - Weak acids
  - Weak bases
  - Salts
- There are several trick/decoy items included that do NOT fit cleanly into any group (mark them "Decoy / Neither" during scoring).
- Points: +1 correct, 0 for decoy labeled correctly, -0.25 for incorrect placement (optional tournament scoring).

Mixed list (give this to students — terms deliberately mixed):
1. HCl
2. NaOH
3. CH3COOH
4. NH3
5. KNO3
6. HF
7. KOH
8. HNO3
9. NaCl
10. NH4Cl
11. H2SO4
12. Ca(OH)2
13. CH3COONa
14. H2CO3
15. CH3NH2
16. HClO4
17. NaHCO3
18. LiOH
19. FeCl3
20. HBr
21. H2O
22. Na2CO3
23. C6H5OH
24. Al(OH)3
25. Ba(OH)2
26. KBr
27. CO2
28. H3PO4
29. NaClO
30. CH3CH2COOH
31. Pyridine
32. Na2SO4
33. NH4OH
34. KHSO4
35. NaNO3
36. Aniline
37. HCN
38. Mg(OH)2
39. HClO
40. CuSO4

| 12 | Ca(OH)2 | Strong base | Group 2 hydroxide; considered a strong base (solubility caveat) | No |
| 13 | CH3COONa | Salt | Salt of weak acid (CH3COOH) and strong base (NaOH) — basic salt behavior | No |

| 16 | HClO4 | Strong acid | Strong oxyacid — fully dissociates | No |
| 17 | NaHCO3 | Salt | Bicarbonate (salt) — often basic/acid-buffering; included as a decoy-salt | No |
| 18 | LiOH | Strong base | Alkali hydroxide — fully dissociates | No |
| 19 | FeCl3 | Salt | Metal salt; hydrolyzes to give acidic solution — good trick example | No |
| 20 | HBr | Strong acid | Hydrogen halide — strong acid (fully dissociates) | No |
| 21 | H2O | Decoy / Neither | Neutral under standard conditions — not in the five target groups | Yes |
| 22 | Na2CO3 | Salt | Carbonate salt; basic solution (salt of weak acid) | No |
| 23 | C6H5OH (phenol) | Weak acid | Aromatic alcohol with acidic hydrogen (weak acid) | No |
| 24 | Al(OH)3 | Decoy (Amphoteric) — classify as Weak base if forced | Amphoteric — reacts as acid or base depending on conditions; tricky | Yes |
| 25 | Ba(OH)2 | Strong base | Group 2 hydroxide; strong base (solubility caveat) | No |
| 26 | KBr | Salt | Neutral salt (strong acid/base parents) | No |
| 27 | CO2 | Decoy / Neither | Gas that forms carbonic acid in water; not directly in the five groups | Yes |
| 28 | H3PO4 | Weak acid | Polyprotic acid; generally a weak acid (grade-11 treatment) | No |
| 29 | NaClO | Salt | Hypochlorite salt (from weak acid HClO and strong base NaOH) — basic salt behavior | No |
| 30 | CH3CH2COOH | Weak acid | Aliphatic carboxylic acid — weak acid | No |
| 31 | Pyridine | Weak base | Aromatic heterocycle — weak base (lone pair on N) | No |

| 36 | Aniline | Weak base | Aromatic amine — weaker base than aliphatic amines | No |
| 37 | HCN | Weak acid | Very weak acid (pKa ~9–10) — hazardous, discuss safety if used | No |
| 38 | Mg(OH)2 | Strong base (sparingly soluble) | Hydroxide of Group 2 — strong base character but low solubility (lax classification) | Yes (tricky solubility) |
| 39 | HClO | Weak acid | Hypochlorous acid — weak oxyacid (used as example of weak acid) | No |
| 40 | CuSO4 | Salt | Transition metal salt; hydrolyzes to give slightly acidic solutions — trick example | No |

Notes for teacher:
- I included deliberate trick/decoy items: H2O, CO2, Al(OH)3 (amphoteric), Mg(OH)2 (sparingly soluble but chemically strong base), and some metal salts (FeCl3, CuSO4) that hydrolyze and behave non‑neutrally — good for discussion.
- You can require students to flag decoys (H2O, CO2, amphoteric solids) for partial credit — encourages critical thinking.
- Safety note: avoid asking students to handle HCN or concentrated strong acids/bases in a classroom activity; treat them as examples only.

How I arranged this: I mixed the 40 terms and provided a keyed table with the "Correct category" for classroom scoring plus a short rationale and a flag where terms are intended as decoys or trick items.
